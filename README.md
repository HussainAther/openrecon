# OpenRecon: AI-Powered CT Reconstruction Toolkit 🚀

## 📌 Overview
**OpenRecon** is an open-source AI-driven Computed Tomography (CT) reconstruction toolkit designed for **low-dose, high-precision imaging**. It includes:
✅ **MART-based iterative reconstruction**  
✅ **AI-powered denoising (GANs, Autoencoders)**  
✅ **Inpainting models for missing-angle CT**  
✅ **Advanced filtering (Gaussian, Bilateral, Median)**  

OpenRecon is part of the **OpenRBYR** ecosystem, focusing on high-fidelity image reconstruction techniques.

## 🚀 Features
- **MART Reconstruction** – Iterative Multiplicative Algebraic Reconstruction Technique
- **GAN-Based Denoising** – AI-based noise removal for low-dose CT scans
- **Inpainting Algorithms** – Restores missing projection data
- **Custom Filters** – Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filtering
- **Pre-trained AI Models** – Load and fine-tune models easily
- **Extensible API** – Can be integrated into cloud & real-time imaging pipelines

## 🛠 Usage
### **1️⃣ Run a Basic MART Reconstruction**
```python
from openrecon.mart_reconstruction import MARTReconstruction
import numpy as np

projections = np.random.rand(64, 64)  # Simulated CT projections
reconstructor = MARTReconstruction(num_iterations=10)
reconstructed_image = reconstructor.reconstruct(projections)
reconstructor.visualize_reconstruction(reconstructed_image)
```

### **2️⃣ Apply AI-Based Denoising**
```python
from openrecon.gan_denoising import DenoisingModel
import torch

model = DenoisingModel()
model.load_pretrained("models/denoising_model.pth")
noisy_image = torch.randn(1, 1, 64, 64)
denosed_image = model(noisy_image)
```
